# AFRINIC's whois client

# Install

Nothing simpler. First tap my taps, and install:

```
% brew tap max13/afrinic
% brew install whois-afr # or max13/whois-afr
```

# Usage

It may be simpler than the install section:

```
% whois-afr
```

And you'll get the usage help.

# Credits

All the credit goes to Afrinic, I just made the homebrew package.
